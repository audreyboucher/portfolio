# Audrey Boucher's portfolio

In this repository, you'll find the code that's currently used on [my portfolio](http://www.audreyboucher.dev/).
This repository is meant as a small overview of the way I structure and code my React projects.

## Mockups

Additionally, the mockups are available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/gg5eF6rQ0m0KwHf52zqwZq/Portfolio).
It's meant to showcase my skills as a UI/UX designer.

## To do

This is an unfinished project and here is still a lot of work to do:

### On the front side

- Handle errors coming from the backend server
- Create dynamic emailings

### On the back side

- Handle message creation
- Send emails to confirm its creation

### Regarding security

### Code improvements

- Add aliases

## Run the project locally
